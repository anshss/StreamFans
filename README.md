## Project Info
There are platforms on the regular internet where you can get paid-only access to a creator's exclusive content, but all of them are based on a recurring payments model, we are focussing on building a blockchain-based solution on comparable social profiles where users can get access to a creator's exclusive content by streaming money to their account on the platform for as long as they are subscribed. This creates a better form of interaction between the user and the creator. Creators on the platform can activate their StreamFans profile on their dashboard which deploys smart contracts, now everyone following them through the StreamFans platform will be minted with an NFT and the stream gets started. These creators can now post exclusive content for their only subscribers. Shortly, we will enable features like customizing the follow NFT drop, streams via Huddle01 to the followers, private chats and chatroom with creators via XMTP.
